      <p id="maintext">The main goal of Paw Pals Adoption Center is to provide loving and permanent homes for animals in need. This includes animals that have been surrendered, lost, or rescued from abusive or neglectful situations. The center works to assess the health and behavior of each animal to ensure they are suitable for adoption and can thrive in their new home. The staff also works to educate the public on responsible pet ownership and the importance of spaying and neutering to reduce overpopulation. In addition, they strive to foster a positive relationship between people and animals by promoting the bond between them.</p>
